# Bible Memory

A free web app for memorizing Scripture with spaced review. Live example: https://biblememoryapp.pages.dev

- Recite a verse from its reference, with help when you need it: a picture, first letters, or listening.
- Spaced review (FSRS) schedules each verse for the day you are about to forget it.
- Make your own cards, with words and pictures on the front and back, or import cards from a CSV or an Anki text export.
- Listen to any chapter of the Berean Standard Bible, read by Barry Hays, with study notes and cross-references.
- Download a backup file and restore it in another browser.

Everything a person saves stays in their own browser. There is no account, no server and no database, and nothing is sent anywhere except requests for Bible text and audio.

## Host your own copy (free)

The `site` folder is the whole app: plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript and data. There is no build step.

**Cloudflare Pages (tested):**

1. Fork this repository, or use it as a template, on GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare, go to Workers & Pages, then Create, then Pages, then Connect to Git, and choose your copy.
3. Set Framework preset to None, leave Build command empty, and set Build output directory to `site`.
4. Save and deploy. Each push to your copy publishes again.

The site has about 6,200 files, under the free plan's 20,000-file limit. The dashboard's drag-and-drop upload takes at most 1,000 files, so use the Git route above (or Wrangler: `wrangler pages deploy site`).

`site/_headers` sets the security headers Cloudflare Pages applies, including the list of hosts allowed to serve Bible text and audio. Other static hosts work too, but may ignore that file.

## Make changes

Edit the files in `site` directly. The main pieces:

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `app.js`, `app.css` | The app's screens |
| `public-memory-api.js` | Saving and loading in the browser (IndexedDB) |
| `scheduling.js`, `vendor/fsrs.js` | Spaced review |
| `recall-panel.js` | Recite, first letters and reveal |
| `user-cards.js`, `card-import.js`, `card-model.js` | Your own cards and imports |
| `audio/` | The listening player |
| `study-data/` | Study notes, dictionary and cross-references |

## Licenses and credits

The app's code is under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`). Bible text, audio, study notes and cross-references keep their own licenses, listed in `CREDITS.md`. If you share a changed copy of the study notes, keep their attribution and share-alike license.
